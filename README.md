<h4 align="center">A powerful HRMS built with React, Node.Js, Express, MySQL ...</h4>


## Description

This Human Resource Management System was made using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react#react-----) amongst other libraries on the frontend and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as well as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) on the backend. As for the database, I used [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as the ORM.

### Features

- User authentication and authorization with [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) and personally developed [authentication middleware hoc](https://github.com/vasilismantz/thesis-fullstack/blob/master/client/src/withAuth.js)
- User Password encryption using hashing with [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- Responsive design and use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Ability to Manage, Add, Update, Delete:
  - Users (Admin, Manager, Employee)
